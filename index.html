      <h4 id="Subjects">SUBJECTS COVERED</h4>
      <p>Athilesh prefers to approach tutoring from a relationship-based perspective. While pre-exam cram sessions are available, he highly recommends taking a couple of sessions to get to know a student's notetaking habits, patterns of mistakes, etc to not only bridge gaps in material by tailoring content delivery to the individual but also improve students' study and scheduling habits.</p>
      <p>Chemistry: Up to and including Organic Chemistry I (no lab courses) <br>Math: Up to and including Multivariable Calculus and Linear Equations<br>Spanish: Up to and including 300-level courses<br>Test Prep: SAT, ACT, GRE</p>

      <h4 id="Schedule">SCHEDULE</h4>
      <p>For now, all scheduling will be done on a case-by-case basis. All pricing will also be done on a case-by-case basis. Pricing is flexible for students with whom I’ve worked in the past, group sessions (2-4 students), and on for need-based discounts.</p>
      <p>I am happy to guarantee my work if necessary–no payment due if you don’t believe it was worth it!</p>
