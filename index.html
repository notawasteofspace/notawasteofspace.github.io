    <p>Tired of tutors who are boring or just give you answers instead of tools to improve? Athilesh is the most educational and entertaining tutor you've ever met!</p>
    <p>A native of northern Virginia and current student at U of M, he has almost a decade of experience in tutoring in both a wide variety of subjects and for a wide variety of grade levels. He enjoys sleeping in his free time.</p>

      <h2 id="Subjects">SUBJECTS COVERED</h2>
      <p>Athilesh prefers to approach tutoring from a relationship-based perspective. While pre-exam cram sessions are available, he highly recommends scheduling a couple of sessions together to get to know a student's notetaking habits, patterns of mistakes, etc. This helps to not only bridge gaps in material by tailoring content delivery to the individual but also improve students' study and scheduling habits.</p>
      <p>Chemistry: up to Orgo I <br>Math: up to Multi/Calc 3 and below <br>Spanish: up to 300-level courses </p>
      <p>Test Prep: SAT (1600/1600), ACT (36/36), GRE (coming soon) </p>

      <h2 id="Schedule">SCHEDULING</h2>
      <p>For now, all scheduling will be done on a case-by-case basis. All pricing will also be done on a case-by-case basis. Pricing is flexible for students with whom I’ve worked in the past, group sessions (2-4 students), and on for need-based discounts.</p>
      <p>I am happy to guarantee my work if necessary–<br>no payment due if you don’t believe it was worth it!</p>
